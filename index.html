        <p>My mom, <strong>Omolara Ajala</strong>, was the most amazing woman I have ever known. She inspired me daily with her strength, love, and kindness. She carried herself with quiet grace, always putting others before herself, and taught me the true meaning of resilience. Her laughter could fill a room, and her words had a way of making everything feel okay. She was not just a mother but my greatest teacher, my comfort, and my guide. In every challenge I face, I still hear her voice cheering me on. Her unwavering belief in me gave me the courage to dream, to try, and to keep going. Even though she is no longer here physically, her presence is felt in every step I take. This tribute is a small way to honor the big role she played—and still plays—in my life.</p>
